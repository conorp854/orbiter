# F = (G * m1 * m2)/d ** 2
#  F: force between two objects with mass
#  G: Gravitational Constant
# m1: mass of object 1
# m2: mass of object 2
#  d: distance between the centres of mass of the two objects

# Mass of Sun:    1.989 * 10 **  30 [kg]
# Mass of Earth:  5.972 * 10 **  24 [kg]
# G:              6.673 * 10 ** -20 [km**3]/[kg s**2]
